# CATERERSNEARME

A Sample CaterersNearMe Clone implemented using HTML5 & CSS

## Intro

Welcome to the CaterersNearMe sample clone! This project is crafted as a demonstration of my web development skills, showcasing a responsive and visually appealing website built using HTML5 and CSS.

## Feature overview

*   [x] **Easy To Use** 
*   [x] **Responsive** 
*   [x] **Fully Functional CSS Animations** 

## The Purpose of This Project?

This clone serves as a testament to my ability to create modern, user-friendly web applications that meet industry standards and exceed user expectations.

## Note -

This clone only leverages HTML5 and CSS, and is devoid of any JS functionality to make the user-experience dynamic, certain functionalities like a hamburger menus can in fact be implemented using plain CSS and HTML5 but it results in an even more bloated CSS file which can get tough to manage, but if needed I could implement the same. 

Further I have used Vite for the project's initialization due to it's seemless adoption of PostCSS which allows for a smooth developer experience & me not having to worry about adding WebKit prefixes to the CSS styles for different browser's compatibility.
